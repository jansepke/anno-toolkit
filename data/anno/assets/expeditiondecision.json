Another specie looks like a huge umbrella, with only its flat treetop bearing leaves; looking closer, a red mixture comes out of the treetrunk: dragonblood! An antique, very rare product used for medicine and  rituals. Looking up, the tree hosts a huge nest on its treetop, bearing a large, red egg guarded by a bird of red feathers. Looking around, the luxurious plateau continues further to the east."

The plateau extends further to the north in intricate corridors between the plateau levels. The river flows down to an estuary in the west. The view offers for a very nice panorama of the island."

His companions pummel the lion with their fists, but it barely seems to acknowledge the blows, and busies itself with goring the unfortunate lad. A lioness follows suite, leaping at a mate’s steward and opening his throat with vicious teeth, and all pretense of resistance finally abandons your crew: &lt;b&gt;broken, the sailors disband and flee back to the savannah,&lt;/b&gt; routed and haunted by the dreadful fates of their comrades."

His companions pummel the lion with their fists, but it barely seems to acknowledge the blows, and busies itself with goring the unfortunate lad. A lioness follows suite, leaping at a mate’s steward and opening his throat with vicious teeth, and all pretense of resistance finally abandons your crew: &lt;b&gt;broken, the sailors disband and flee back to the savannah,&lt;/b&gt; routed and haunted by the dreadful fates of their comrades."
